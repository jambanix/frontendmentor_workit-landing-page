## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This was my first time using grid and having to draw shapes and keep their proportion when the screen size changes

### Continued development

I will continue to do these challenges - won't lie this one was tough but I only started learning CSS a couple of weeks ago so 
I'm happy with the result
